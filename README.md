## About
Gruvbox Dark Medium Theme

Please refer to screenshots to see examples of languages this theme's been used on.

Other languages haven't been tested against, but PRs are welcomed.
To contribute, please try opening sample codes from the language you're trying to use in both `vim` (or `sublime-text`) (with `Dark Medium Contrast Gruvbox`) and `vscode`, then try matching them as much as possible.

## Tips
 - `tmTheme` is not being used since I think the default VS Dark+ works better for syntax highlighting & (seems to) require fewer configurations
 - In the `json` file, `scope` can be an `array` or a `string` of CSS classes
 - VSCode's `Developer: Inspect TM Scopes` command is useful to find out the scope
